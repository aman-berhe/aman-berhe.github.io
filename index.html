            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is <strong>Aman BERHE</strong>, and I am a researcher in NLP for Health. Welcome to my page where you can learn more about my work and publications.</p>
            <p>I grew up in Mekelle and completed my first bachelor's degree at <strong>Mekelle Institute of Technology (MIT)</strong> in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. I enjoyed my time at MIT, especially the life I had with my friends.</p>
            <p>I spent a few years as an Assistant Lecturer at <strong>Mekelle Institute of Technology, Mekelle University</strong>, and previously at Aksum University, teaching computer science until I left for France in 2015 to continue my studies.</p>
            <p>I earned my master's degree in <strong>Machine Learning and Data Mining</strong> from the <strong>University of Jean-Monnet</strong>, Saint-Etienne, France. I had the opportunity to complete two research internships at prestigious French national research labs known as <strong>INRIA</strong> and <strong>CNRS</strong>.</p>
            <p>Continuing my studies, I chose to pursue a PhD. Consequently, I completed my <strong>PhD</strong> in machine learning and NLP (AI) at the <strong>University of Paris-Saclay (Université Paris-Saclay)</strong> in the research center, <strong>CNRS</strong>, in the laboratory of <strong>LIMSI</strong> (now <strong>LISN</strong>).</p>
            <p>My passion for AI, especially in NLP and ML, led me to undertake a <strong>PostDoc</strong> program at the research center <strong>IRD</strong> and the laboratory <strong>UMMISCO</strong> in collaboration with the company <strong>Quinten</strong> (a company that works in AI with applications in healthcare). I gained diverse experience that helped me propose practical solutions to real-world problems.</p>
            <p>I have built various language models for different purposes. The first biomedical language model was I built was <strong><a herf="hat.deepseek.com">AliBERT</a></strong>, a French biomedical pretrained language model. I then used the model to propose solutions to different biomedical problems for various companies.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I work on automating systematic literature reviews. Systematic reviews are a lengthy process mainly done by experts in the biomedical domain, making it a very expensive task. Automating this process saves both time and money.</p>
            <p>Finally, I am deeply involved with LLMs, including using LLMs, fine-tuning, instruction tuning, and developing systems that utilize LLMs. I am cureently applying  different models to different productions that can have a positive impact on companies and society in general. I am specifcally working on real-tme inputs and response, text, audio, and images</p>

            <h1>Researcher in NLP, LLMs, ML, and AI for Health</h1>
            <p>
                As a researcher in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for health, my passion lies at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and healthcare innovation. I am deeply committed to exploring how advanced computational techniques can revolutionize the medical field, particularly through the development and application of intelligent systems that improve patient outcomes and streamline healthcare processes.
